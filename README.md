## Model Evaluation & Validation
## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with**'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a**'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with**'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the**Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started
In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
- 16 data points have an `'MDEV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain**missing or censored values** and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an**outlier** and has been removed.
- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MDEV'` are essential. The remaining**non-relevant features** have been excluded.
- The feature `'MDEV'` has been**multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.

Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import visuals as vs # Supplementary code
from sklearn.cross_validation import ShuffleSplit

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Boston housing dataset
data = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')
prices = data['MDEV']
features = data.drop('MDEV', axis = 1)

# Success
print "Boston housing dataset has {} data points with {} variables each.".format(*data.shape)
```

    Boston housing dataset has 489 data points with 4 variables each.


## Data Exploration
In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.

Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into**features** and the**target variable**. The**features**, `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`, give us quantitative information about each data point. The**target variable**, `'MDEV'`, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in `features` and `prices`, respectively.

### Implementation: Calculate Statistics
For your very first coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since `numpy` has already been imported for you, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of `'MDEV'`, which is stored in `prices`.
  - Store each calculation in their respective variable.


```python
# Minimum price of the data
minimum_price = np.min(prices)

# Maximum price of the data
maximum_price = np.max(prices)

# Mean price of the data
mean_price = np.mean(prices)

# Median price of the data
median_price = np.median(prices)

# Standard deviation of prices of the data
std_price = np.std(prices)

# Show the calculated statistics
print "Statistics for Boston housing dataset:\n"
print "Minimum price: ${:,.2f}".format(minimum_price)
print "Maximum price: ${:,.2f}".format(maximum_price)
print "Mean price: ${:,.2f}".format(mean_price)
print "Median price ${:,.2f}".format(median_price)
print "Standard deviation of prices: ${:,.2f}".format(std_price)
```

    Statistics for Boston housing dataset:

    Minimum price: $105,000.00
    Maximum price: $1,024,800.00
    Mean price: $454,342.94
    Median price $438,900.00
    Standard deviation of prices: $165,171.13


### Question 1 - Feature Observation
As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):
- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of all Boston homeowners who have a greater net worth than homeowners in the neighborhood.
- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.

_Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an**increase** in the value of `'MDEV'` or a**decrease** in the value of `'MDEV'`? Justify your answer for each._  
**Hint:** Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?

**Answer:**

For the `RM` feature:
-**Intuition:** An inrease in `RM` will increase `MDEV`
- A higher value for the avg. number of rooms in neighbouring houses could mean the house is in an area that generally has large houses. This can lead us to believe that there are generally fewer houses in the area, hence higher property value.
- This could be misleading for small towns since they too will have larger and fewer houses in a given area yet may still have (relatively) lower property values due to location.

For the `LSTAT` feature:
-**Intuition:** An inrease in `LSTAT` will decrease `MDEV`
- Being in an area that has a relatively lower net worth could mean lower property values. This may be an even stronger indicator if combined with the assumption for the `RM` feature above.

For the `PTRATIO` feature:
-**Intuition:** An inrease in `PTRATIO` will decrease `MDEV`
- A higher student-teacher ratio could mean that the area is more populated than the current infrastructure can handle. This will logically cause a drop in the house prices in that area.
- Another assumption could that lower student-teacher ratio means more private schools / specialized academies in the area which means a higher standard of education, hence a higher standard of living. All of which are things that leads us to believe an increase in `PRATIO` could mean a decrease in `MDEV`.

## Developing a Model
In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.

### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric
It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions.

The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the**target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 always fails to predict the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the**features**. *A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is no better than one that naively predicts the mean of the target variable.*

For the `performance_metric` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict`.
- Assign the performance score to the `score` variable.


```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict):
    """ Calculates and returns the performance score between
        true and predicted values based on the metric chosen. """


    score = r2_score(y_true, y_predict)

    # Return the score
    return score
```

### Question 2 - Goodness of Fit
Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:

| True Value | Prediction |
| :-------------: | :--------: |
| 3.0 | 2.5 |
| -0.5 | 0.0 |
| 2.0 | 2.1 |
| 7.0 | 7.8 |
| 4.2 | 5.3 |
*Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? Why or why not?*

Run the code cell below to use the `performance_metric` function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.


```python
# Calculate the performance of this model
score = performance_metric([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
print "Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of {:.3f}.".format(score)
```

    Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.


**Answer:**

Yes. By Inspecting the data, we can intuitively observe that values of predictions are generally close to the the true values. Also, when we run our R^2 tests, we get 0.923 which is considered a high accuracy value.

### Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data
Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.

For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to shuffle and split the `features` and `prices` data into training and testing sets.
  - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
  - Set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
- Assign the train and testing splits to `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.


```python
# Import 'train_test_split'
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Success
print "Training and testing split was successful."
```

    Training and testing split was successful.


### Question 3 - Training and Testing
*What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?*  
**Hint:** What could go wrong with not having a way to test your model?

**Answer:**

We split the data into train and test partitions in order to get an honest evaluation of how our algorithims will perform with a data set it hasn't seen before (i.e. the closest possible to future data).

If we train and test on the same dataset, the liklihood that our algorithim will successfully deal with new real world data is relatively lower.

By doing this split, we can check to see if our algorithims are over fitting.

----

## Analyzing Model Performance
In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

### Learning Curves
The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.  

Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.


```python
# Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths
vs.ModelLearning(features, prices)
```


![png](static/output_20_0.png)


### Question 4 - Learning the Data
*Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? Would having more training points benefit the model?*  
**Hint:** Are the learning curves converging to particular scores?

**Answer:**

Graph #2 // max-depth = 3

The training curve starts with a score of 1, which is expected since our model has been built around it. It does however decline slighly during the initial training points since our model isn't overfitted (as compared to the max-depth = 10 where the training curve keeps a consistent score).

It's also expected to see that the training set improves greatly in the begining and reaches a limit of about 0.8 accuracy score. Other graphs that have a higher or lower max-depth value are displaying lower accuracy that both curves are converging to.

Having more data will not benefit the accuracy of the predictions since the score values are converging to 0.8. This is true for both training and testing datasets.

### Complexity Curves
The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves â€” one for training and one for validation. Similar to the**learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  

Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions.


```python
vs.ModelComplexity(X_train, y_train)
```


![png](static/output_24_0.png)


### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
*When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?*  
**Hint:** How do you know when a model is suffering from high bias or high variance?

**Answer:**

When a model is trained with max-depth of 1, we can say the model suffers from high bias since our Model Complexity is relatively lower. When the model is trained with a max-depth of 10, it suffers from high variance. As model complexity increases, bias decreases and variance increases.

We can observe this above if we look at the training and testing curves in the Complexity Performance graph. As we increase our maximum depth, the scores diverage or become more variable.

### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model
*Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? What intuition lead you to this answer?*

**Answer:**

Graph #2 // max-depth = 3

When the maximum depth is 3, we minimize both variance and bias, hence it's the bence level of complexity for our model.

Choosing more than 3 leads us to high variance and going lower than 3 leads to lower scores and high bias.

-----

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`.

### Question 7 - Grid Search
*What is the grid search technique and how it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?*

**Answer:**

Grid search is a technique that allows us to run our algorithim with permutations of the important parameters, we can then choose the permutation that gives us the best fit.

For example, we discussed above how we may need to change the max-depth value and check which configuration gives us the lowest variance and bias. We achieve this programatically by using grid search to try out the different values of max-depth.

### Question 8 - Cross-Validation
*What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?*  
**Hint:** Much like the reasoning behind having a testing set, what could go wrong with using grid search without a cross-validated set?

**Answer:**

K-fold cross-validation is a way of randomly partitioning the data into K equal samples. One of those segments is kept for testing and rest is used for training. This folding process is then repeated, each time while using a different partition for testing as shown in the figure below:

![alt text](https://udacity-github-sync-content.s3.amazonaws.com/_imgs/31967/1467969476/k-fold.png "K-fold Illustration")


This technique is useful when we use it in combination with grid search since we can run each permutation of grid search with a different partition from the data, K.

The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.

If we do grid search on a broken / bad dataset, the different permutations of our algorithim will return highly varying results compared to the average estimation.

Another great benefit of using k-fold with GridSearch to provide the best possible learning results and validation with a possibly limited data set.

### Implementation: Fitting a Model
Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the**decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.

For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.
- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.
- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.
- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object.
  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.


```python
# Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

def fit_model(X, y):
    """ Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a
        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. """

    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data
    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(X.shape[0], n_iter = 10, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)

    # Create a decision tree regressor object
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)

    # Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10
    params = {'max_depth': range(1, 11)}

    # Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer'
    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)

    # Create the grid search object
    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor, params, scoring_fnc, cv=cv_sets)

    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model
    grid = grid.fit(X, y)

    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data
    return grid.best_estimator_
```

### Making Predictions
Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a *decision tree regressor*, the model has learned *what the best questions to ask about the input data are*, and can respond with a prediction for the**target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown â€” such as data the model was not trained on.

### Question 9 - Optimal Model
_What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in**Question 6**?_  

Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.


```python
# Fit the training data to the model using grid search
reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)

# Produce the value for 'max_depth'
print "Parameter 'max_depth' is {} for the optimal model.".format(reg.get_params()['max_depth'])
```

Parameter 'max_depth' is 4 for the optimal model.


**Answer:**

The `max_depth` value for the optimal model is 4.

This result aligns with my initial intuition from Question 6. The optimal model attempts to decrease variance and bias and to achieve this the model complexity can't be too low or too high.

### Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices
Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:

| Feature | Client 1 | Client 2 | Client 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Total number of rooms in home | 5 rooms | 4 rooms | 8 rooms |
| Household net worth (income) | Top 34th percent | Bottom 45th percent | Top 7th percent |
| Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools | 15-to-1 | 22-to-1 | 12-to-1 |

*What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at? Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective features?*
**Hint:** Use the statistics you calculated in the**Data Exploration** section to help justify your response.  

Run the code block below to have your optimized model make predictions for each client's home.

```python
# Produce a matrix for client data
client_data = [[5, 35, 15], # Client 1
               [4, 55, 22], # Client 2
               [8, 7, 12]]  # Client 3

# Show predictions
for i, price in enumerate(reg.predict(client_data)):
    print "Predicted selling price for Client {}'s home: ${:,.2f}".format(i+1, price)
```

```
Predicted selling price for Client 1's home: $344,400.00
Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: $237,478.72
Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: $931,636.36
```


**Answer:**

The results predicted by the model are reasonable and along with initial hypothesis.

Let's consider Client 1, who has a predicted house price of \$344,400.00 for 5 rooms. If we change Household Networth field to the 10th percentile from the 35th, the house price goes up to $486,584.48 (`+0.85` standard devations), which also aligns initial assumptions.

A similar response happens when we increase the number of rooms to 7, the house price goes up to $ 577,500.00 (`+1.4` standard devations).

The Student-teacher ratio however seems to have a smaller impact on the house prices, which we inspect by changes Client 1's ratio from 15:1 to 20:1 for the price to decrease. This is along the lines of our initial assumptions as well.

**As a real-estate agent**, and based purely on financial analysis, I'd recommend the following to my clients:
* Client 1 - Don't Sell
* Client 2 - Sell
* Client 3 - Sell

Earlier in this project, we explored the data and found out that the average house price in our dataset is $ 454,342.94. Also the average number of rooms for our dataset is ~6.4.

This means Client 1 and 2 both have houses below the average. For Client 1, I'd recommend that s/he keep the house because I believe its value will increase if the networth (currently 35th percentile) can increase. I would however advice clients 2 and 3 to sell because I don't think their values will change as time passes.

### Sensitivity
An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on.


```python
vs.PredictTrials(features, prices, fit_model, client_data)
```

```
Trial 1: $332,850.00
Trial 2: $411,417.39
Trial 3: $346,500.00
Trial 4: $324,450.00
Trial 5: $413,334.78
Trial 6: $411,931.58
Trial 7: $344,750.00
Trial 8: $407,232.00
Trial 9: $306,000.00
Trial 10: $316,890.00

Range in prices: $107,334.78
```


### Question 11 - Applicability
*In a few sentences, discuss whether the constructed model should or should not be used in a real-world setting.*  
**Hint:** Some questions to answering:
- *How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978?*
- *Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home?*
- *Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?*
- *Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?*

**Answer:**

This model should not be used in a real-world setting for a few reasons:

* Data collected almost 40 years ago would be irrelevant to today's prices as markets evolve and change, house prices and other factors such as currency value will also change.

* The data provided on each home isn't sufficient to make accurate predictions in today's marketplace. For example, you could start taking into account features such as parks in the area or the number of universities in the city to better predict the price of a house.

* The model makes predictions with a range of about 10% (compared to max price value) which isn't considered robust enough.

* The model is trained with data from a certain city in a certain point in time, hence the model will likely underform with variable data from different types of cities (e.g. rural cities) as discussed in the answer to Question 1.
